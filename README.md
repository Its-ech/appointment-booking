Appointment Booking with Login & Signup

This is one of my early self-taught frontend projects, built before I learned how to use Git and GitHub.
It is a simple appointment booking system with signup, login, and password reset flows using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
I used this project to practice multi-page forms, basic client-side validation, and managing fake user data in JSON files.
